## Installations:
  1. You will need to install Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.
  2. You will need to install the Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

## Project Motivation:
    I'm really intreasted in invstegating customer spending score based on their Gender, Age group and Annual income then cluster them and target specific segments.
  
## File Descriptions:
  1. Mall_Customers.csv: This is the Dataset I used in my project .
  2. Mall Customers.ipynb: This is my notebook where I did my analysis.

## How To Interact With Your Project:
  - We found some interesting findings where people in the Age group 24-29 and 30-35 tend to have higher spending score than any other Age group.
  - Then I used Kmeans clustering algorithm to separate customers based on their Annual income and their Spending score.
